This is a project for an e-commerce company that sells clothing online and also have in-store advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.

The project is to help the company decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website.
